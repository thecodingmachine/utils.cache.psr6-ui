PSR-6 cache UI for Mouf
=======================

When you include this library in your [Mouf](http://mouf-php.com) project, an additional button appears in the Mouf navigation bar.

By clicking this button, you can purge automatically all PSR-6 cache pool instances that are declared in Mouf.

Also, a "cache" menu item is added providing a UI letting UI selectively purge some cache pools.
